# Vaccine-slot-booking
## Description
This is a script to find the available slot in a range of pincodes.<br />
It also showa which pincode gives what kind of vaccine and the location and perfect address of the vaccination center.<br />
Also it gives the total number of vaccines available in the range of entered pincode.
## Technology Used
the main source code script.py is written on Python.<br />
Here we Fetches the Database from APISetu and collect the data and address from the database where I've used calenderByPin API to fetch the data.<br />
Then the output format is for showing individual center's address, center name, type of vaccine and available vaccine for a particular date.<br />
## Yet to do
I'm planning to add latitudes and longitude based seraching where user can find his/her nearest available vaccination slot or center without giving pincodes.
